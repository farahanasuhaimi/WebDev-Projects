# Photography Website

## A tutorial in Dev-Ed course.

- Started on December 2020
- Finished 10 Jan 2021
- Built with Vanilla HTML, CSS and just a litte bit of JS

## What I've learned through out this projects:

1. Grid is easy to use too:

- But you have to undertand the syntax
- Once the syntax is gathered, you can make unimaginable positioning for you website
- The design can be more complex than what you have in flex.

2. Learn how to implement Burger menu too for mobile design.
