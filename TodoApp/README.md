# This is a repo of my todo app.

- Started on December 2020
- Finished 2 Jan 2021
- Built with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS

## What I've learned through out this projects:

1. Basic JS skeletons are:

- Selector
- Event Listeners &
- Functions

  A. Selector section is the connector between HTML file (.document) and the variables for the JS script.

  B. Event listeners section is the connector between HTML file (.document) and the Functions for the JS workaround.

2. The directory holds the exact copy of the app from the tutorial. I did some changes for my website live view.
